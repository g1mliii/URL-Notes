# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UI Modernization feature aims to upgrade the Anchored web application's styling and interactivity by implementing modern web development tools that work seamlessly with the existing GitHub Pages static hosting setup. This enhancement will replace custom CSS with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for consistent design, and add Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity, while maintaining the existing vanilla JavaScript architecture and ocean anchor theme.

The modernization will improve development velocity, design consistency, and user experience without requiring a build process or changing the fundamental architecture. All tools will be loaded via CDN to maintain compatibility with the current GitHub Pages deployment strategy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI, so that I can build consistent designs faster and maintain unified styling across all pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Tailwind CSS THEN the system SHALL load Tailwind via CDN without requiring a build process
2. WHEN adding DaisyUI THEN the system SHALL include DaisyUI components that extend Tailwind's utility classes
3. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use utility-first CSS classes instead of custom CSS where possible
4. WHEN maintaining the ocean anchor theme THEN the system SHALL configure custom color palette in Tailwind config
5. WHEN updating existing styles THEN the system SHALL preserve the glassmorphism design aesthetic using Tailwind utilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity, so that I can add dynamic behavior without writing extensive JavaScript files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Alpine.js THEN the system SHALL load Alpine via CDN without requiring a build process
2. WHEN adding interactivity THEN the system SHALL use Alpine directives (x-data, x-show, x-model, @click) directly in HTML
3. WHEN creating modals and dropdowns THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js instead of custom JavaScript event handlers
4. WHEN managing form state THEN the system SHALL use Alpine's reactive data binding
5. WHEN implementing toggles and dynamic content THEN the system SHALL leverage Alpine's declarative syntax

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved button and form styling, so that the interface feels more modern and consistent across all pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing buttons THEN the system SHALL display consistent button styles using DaisyUI button classes
2. WHEN interacting with forms THEN the system SHALL show modern form inputs with proper focus states and validation styling
3. WHEN using authentication forms THEN the system SHALL maintain the ocean theme while using DaisyUI form components
4. WHEN viewing the subscription interface THEN the system SHALL use DaisyUI card and button components for pricing display
5. WHEN accessing account settings THEN the system SHALL use consistent form styling throughout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved modal and dropdown interactions, so that the interface feels more responsive and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening modals THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js for smooth show/hide transitions
2. WHEN using dropdowns THEN the system SHALL implement Alpine.js click-outside functionality for proper closing behavior
3. WHEN viewing export options THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js for dynamic format selection and preview
4. WHEN managing notes THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js for expandable note cards and inline editing states
5. WHEN navigating settings THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js for tabbed interfaces and collapsible sections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing ocean anchor theme, so that the brand identity remains consistent while using modern styling tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Tailwind THEN the system SHALL define custom color palette matching the existing ocean blues (#1B4F72, #2E86AB, #A8DADC, #457B9D)
2. WHEN applying glassmorphism effects THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's backdrop-blur and background opacity utilities
3. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing visual hierarchy and spacing
4. WHEN using DaisyUI themes THEN the system SHALL customize the theme to match the ocean anchor aesthetic
5. WHEN preserving branding THEN the system SHALL ensure anchor iconography and nautical concepts remain prominent

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure compatibility with the existing GitHub Pages setup, so that deployment remains simple and automated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading Tailwind CSS THEN the system SHALL use CDN links that work with GitHub Pages static hosting
2. WHEN loading DaisyUI THEN the system SHALL use CDN links that don't require npm or build processes
3. WHEN loading Alpine.js THEN the system SHALL use CDN links with proper defer attributes for correct initialization
4. WHEN deploying changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing commit-and-push deployment workflow
5. WHEN testing locally THEN the system SHALL work by opening HTML files directly in the browser

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to gradually migrate existing custom CSS, so that I can maintain functionality while improving the codebase incrementally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating styles THEN the system SHALL replace custom CSS with Tailwind utilities where possible
2. WHEN preserving complex styles THEN the system SHALL keep custom CSS for glassmorphism effects that can't be replicated with utilities
3. WHEN updating components THEN the system SHALL migrate one component at a time to avoid breaking changes
4. WHEN maintaining responsive design THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's responsive prefixes instead of custom media queries
5. WHEN cleaning up code THEN the system SHALL remove unused custom CSS after successful migration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved responsive design, so that the application works better on mobile devices and tablets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's mobile-first responsive utilities
2. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN the system SHALL implement proper touch targets using DaisyUI component sizing
3. WHEN viewing forms on mobile THEN the system SHALL use responsive form layouts that work well on small screens
4. WHEN navigating on tablets THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate spacing and sizing for touch interaction
5. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality across all screen sizes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to improve development velocity, so that I can implement new features and fixes more quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling new components THEN the system SHALL use pre-built DaisyUI components instead of writing custom CSS
2. WHEN adding interactivity THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js directives instead of writing custom JavaScript event handlers
3. WHEN creating responsive layouts THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's utility classes instead of custom media queries
4. WHEN maintaining consistency THEN the system SHALL rely on design system tokens instead of hardcoded values
5. WHEN debugging styles THEN the system SHALL benefit from Tailwind's utility-based approach for easier troubleshooting

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced loading states and micro-interactions, so that the application feels more polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js to show loading states and spinners
2. WHEN submitting forms THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback using Alpine's reactive data
3. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's hover utilities for smooth transitions
4. WHEN completing actions THEN the system SHALL show success states using Alpine.js conditional rendering
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL display error messages using Alpine.js and DaisyUI alert components
