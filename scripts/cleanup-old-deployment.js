üßπ Cleanup Old Deployment Setup

## ‚úÖ BEFORE CLEANUP - Verify New Deployment Works:

1. Check new GitHub Pages is live:
   - https://g1mliii.github.io/URL-Notes
   - https://anchored.site

2. Test critical files:
   - https://anchored.site/config.js (should work now!)
   - https://anchored.site/health.json
   - https://anchored.site/js/monitoring.js

## üóëÔ∏è SAFE CLEANUP STEPS:

### Step 1: Remove Old Workflow (Optional)
The old cross-repo workflow in this repository:
- .github/workflows/deploy.yml (can be deleted)
- .github/workflows/deploy-direct.yml (can be deleted)

### Step 2: Delete Old Repository
Once new deployment is confirmed working:
- Go to: https://github.com/g1mliii/Anchored/settings
- Scroll to bottom -> "Delete this repository"
- Type: g1mliii/Anchored
- Confirm deletion

### Step 3: Update DNS (if needed)
Your DNS should now point to:
- CNAME: anchored.site -> g1mliii.github.io
- (GitHub will handle the /URL-Notes path automatically)

## üéØ BENEFITS AFTER CLEANUP:

‚úÖ Single repository to manage
‚úÖ Direct file editing/drag-drop works
‚úÖ No token permission issues
‚úÖ Simpler deployment process
‚úÖ All files accessible immediately

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:

- Only delete old repo AFTER confirming new site works
- Keep a backup if you're unsure
- The new approach is much better anyway!

Current status: Ready for cleanup once new deployment is verified.
