# Custom Roles Documentation - Pre-Upgrade

## Analysis Results ✅

**No custom roles found** - only system roles detected:
- `supabase_read_only_user`
- `supabase_realtime_admin` 
- `supabase_replication_admin`
- `supabase_storage_admin`

## Impact on Upgrade

Since all roles are Supabase system roles:
- ✅ **No action required** - system roles are automatically recreated
- ✅ **No passwords to reset** - system roles managed by Supabase
- ✅ **No custom permissions to restore** - all permissions are standard

## Your URL Notes Extension

Your extension uses standard Supabase authentication:
- `anon` role for public access
- `authenticated` role for logged-in users  
- `service_role` for admin operations (Edge Functions)

All of these will work normally after the upgrade.
