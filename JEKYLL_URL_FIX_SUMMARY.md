# Jekyll Clean URLs Fix Summary

## Problem
The web application was using hardcoded `.html` extensions in JavaScript redirects and path checking, but Jekyll serves pages without `.html` extensions (clean URLs). This was causing 404 errors during authentication flows and navigation.

## Files Modified

### 1. `js/app.js`
- **Fixed**: Authentication redirect logic to use `/dashboard` instead of `dashboard.html`
- **Fixed**: Protected page detection to check for `/dashboard` and `/account` paths
- **Fixed**: Logout redirect to use `/` instead of `index.html`
- **Fixed**: Page type detection for initialization

### 2. `js/auth.js`
- **Fixed**: OAuth callback redirect to `/dashboard`
- **Fixed**: Password reset redirects to `/`
- **Fixed**: Authentication success redirect logic
- **Fixed**: Sign out redirects to `/`
- **Fixed**: Protected page detection
- **Fixed**: All error handling redirects

### 3. `js/dashboard.js`
- **Fixed**: Page detection to use `/dashboard` path

### 4. `js/account.js`
- **Fixed**: Page detection to use `/account` path

### 5. `monitoring-production-config.json`
- **Fixed**: Health check endpoints to use clean URLs

### 6. `health-check-monitoring.js`
- **Fixed**: Monitoring endpoints to use clean URLs

## URL Mapping Changes

| Old URL | New URL |
|---------|---------|
| `index.html` | `/` |
| `dashboard.html` | `/dashboard` |
| `account.html` | `/account` |

## Path Detection Logic Updated

### Before:
```javascript
if (currentPath.includes('dashboard.html')) {
    // Dashboard logic
}
```

### After:
```javascript
if (currentPath.includes('/dashboard')) {
    // Dashboard logic
}
```

## Testing

Created `test-jekyll-urls.html` to verify:
- Current page detection works correctly
- Navigation redirects function properly
- Path matching logic handles both clean URLs and legacy URLs

## Impact

✅ **Fixed**: 404 errors during login/logout flows
✅ **Fixed**: Navigation between pages
✅ **Fixed**: Authentication redirects
✅ **Fixed**: Protected page access control
✅ **Fixed**: Health monitoring endpoints

## Verification Steps

1. Test login flow: Should redirect to `/dashboard` after successful authentication
2. Test logout: Should redirect to `/` (home page)
3. Test direct navigation: `/dashboard` and `/account` should load correctly
4. Test protected page access: Unauthenticated users should be redirected to `/`

## Notes

- Jekyll automatically handles both `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/` URLs
- The HTML files still exist with Jekyll front matter for proper routing
- All monitoring and health check systems updated to use clean URLs
- Legacy `.html` URLs will still work due to Jekyll's default behavior, but the app now uses clean URLs consistently
