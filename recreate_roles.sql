-- Role Recreation Script - Run AFTER Supabase Upgrade
-- ANALYSIS: No custom roles found - this file not needed

-- All detected roles are Supabase system roles:
-- - supabase_read_only_user
-- - supabase_realtime_admin  
-- - supabase_replication_admin
-- - supabase_storage_admin

-- These are automatically recreated during upgrade.
-- No manual intervention required.

-- Your URL Notes extension uses standard roles:
-- - anon (public access)
-- - authenticated (logged-in users)
-- - service_role (Edge Functions)
-- 
-- All will work normally after upgrade.
